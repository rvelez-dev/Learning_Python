# Learning Python 
This folder is a collection of my personal Python practice as I strengthen my programming fundamentals and problem-solving skills. 
I'm learning at my own pace, combining handwritten logic with terminal testing to build a deeper understanding of how code works.

#Programs 
- guessing_game.py
  A number guessing game using:
  * If statements
  * Booleans
  * Random module
  * User input
  * Print statements
 This was one of my first Python projects and helped me understand conditional and control flow in an engaging way
---

- handwritten_practice.py
A file of short programs I wrote by hand before testing in the terminal. These cover:
  * User input
  * Basic arithmetic
  * Lists
  * Modules
  * If/elif/else logic
Handwritting my code before running it helps me focus, retain information better, and strengthen my problem-solving ability

#Why This Folder Exits 
I am passionate about becoming a thoughtful and capable programmer. These projects may seem small, but they represent the effort I am 
putting into learning Python from the ground up to understand how and why code works
